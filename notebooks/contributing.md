## Add your own folder

1. Create a folder in `projects` with a [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/) notebook, multiple notebooks, or a book. Add a link to the scrapbook at the top of your notebooks. 
You need to have a `.devcontainer` folder in it.

2. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-tutorials/pulls) adding it at the bottom of the [table of contents](https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-tutorials/blob/main/notebooks/toc.edn).
