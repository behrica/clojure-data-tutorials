doesn't need to be pulished

just add your examples

https://www.contributor-covenant.org/


### use PRs
not for gatekeeping
just making sure things are coherent
the answer will almost always be 'yes'


### where to put new examples?

If you can do with the default stack:
add a namespace at the `main` project

If you need specific dependencies or other setup details:
add your own project, starting with a copy of `template`

A new type of project ...

A project of specific tooling (e.g., using Portal)


#### special projects
- Python stuff
- HDF
- scicloj.ml


#### Where to put your namespace?
(a list with links to deps files (and other setup details like python setup))


## Editor guidelines:
