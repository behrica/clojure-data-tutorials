This project builds [The Clojure Data Tutorials page](https://scicloj.github.io/clojure-data-tutorials/) that contains
Community-contributed tutorials for the emerging Clojure data stack.

You can interact with the tutorials by cloning this project and starting a REPL in the relevant subfolders.
All tutorials have a mandatory devcontainer configuration. This allows to isolate the "native dependencies",
which are very common in Clojure Data Science approaches, from each other.
It makes as well sure, that all tutorials are easy reproducible. (using any tools which supports devcontainer, for example VSCode)

This project is part of the [SciCloj community](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/about/).
