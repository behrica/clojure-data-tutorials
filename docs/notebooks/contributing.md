# Contributing

There are two ways to contribute to the scrapbook. Both are encouraged, depending on your convenience.

## Using your own repo

1. Create a repo with a [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/) notebook, multiple notebooks, or a book. Add a link to the scrapbook at the top of your notebooks. For an example repo, see [noj-getting-started](https://github.com/scicloj/noj-getting-started/tree/main).
2. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-scrapbook/pulls) adding it at the bottom of the [table of contents](https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-scrapbook/blob/main/notebooks/toc.edn).

## Updating the scrapbook repo

1. Please discuss it with us first. Together, we will consider the appropirate locations, etc.
2. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-scrapbook/pulls) adding (or updating) notebooks or books under the scrapbook's [repo](https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-scrapbook/), and updating the [table of contents](https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-scrapbook/blob/main/notebooks/toc.edn). Begin your commit messages with the name of the relevant notebook or book. E.g., "Random Forest Tutorial - added data visualizations".
